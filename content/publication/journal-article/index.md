abstract: We propose a scheme to realize quantum cloning of an unknown M-qudit equatorial-like entangled state. The first stage of the protocol requires teleportation. After the teleportation is accomplished, the receiver can reestablish the original state. In the second stage of the protocol, with the assistance (through a single-particle projective measurement) of the preparer, the perfect copy of an original state can be produced at the site of the sender. Our scheme requires a single maximally entangled qudit pair as the quantum channel and three dits classical communication. The scheme is feasible at the expense of consuming local resources which include M âˆ’ 1 ancillary qudits introduced by the receiver and additional bi-qudit operations. Moreover, we construct a sort of unitary transformations which ensure ancillary qudits are not necessarily introduced by the sender. Comparing to the previous protocols, the proposed protocol is economical due to that the cost of both quantum nonlocal resources and classical communication is lowest.
