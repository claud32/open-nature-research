abstract: Since the introduction of automated driving systems on California roads in 2014, there has been ongoing debate regarding their relative safety compared to human driving. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of accident frequencies for both automated and human-operated vehicles by examining the latest data from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Accident frequency—defined as the number of accidents per mile traveled—is calculated under varying environmental conditions such as weather and road types. The data includes autonomous vehicle traffic collisions, disengagement reports, weather-related crash statistics, and traffic volume trends. Visual tools such as tables and column charts are used to compare accident patterns across different roadway and weather conditions between 2014 and 2018. The findings of this research offer empirical evidence to evaluate the current safety levels of autonomous vehicles and provide recommendations for policy development and future safety benchmarks. The results will be submitted to the California DMV for public dissemination, supporting informed decision-making in transportation safety regulations and contributing to safer roadways across the state.
