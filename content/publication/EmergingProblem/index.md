abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have become increasingly common in several U.S. states, particularly California, where companies like Tesla, Google, and Uber have led their development. Despite the promising future of AV technology, concerns over public safety are growing due to a rise in accidents involving self-driving cars, including a fatal crash in Arizona in 2018. This paper examines the emerging public health risks associated with AVs, particularly their frequent disengagements and accidents on street roads as opposed to highways. It evaluates current regulations implemented by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), and highlights regulatory gaps within agencies such as Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol (CHP). The technical mechanisms of AVs, such as sensor-based environmental awareness, are explored to better understand the root causes of AV-related accidents. Based on accident data and policy analyses, this paper offers targeted recommendations for DMV, Caltrans, and CHP to improve road safety, such as implementing speed restrictions, creating autonomous lanes, and establishing AV-specific enforcement strategies. Without these interventions, the rapid growth in AV adoption could pose significant risks to pedestrians and public health.
