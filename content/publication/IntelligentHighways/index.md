abstract: ‘This study investigates whether intelligent highways and separate lanes can reduce the high accident frequency of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on California highways. Building on prior research that found AVs experience accident frequencies approximately 12 times higher than conventional vehicles on highways, this experiment measured disengagement frequencies as a proxy for AV safety. Disengagements, as defined by the California Code of Regulations, indicate a failure of the autonomous system requiring manual takeover. The study involved three groups: a control group of AVs on normal highways, and two experimental groups—AVs on intelligent highways and AVs on separate lanes. All vehicles traveled 1,000 miles, and disengagement data were recorded. Results show that AVs on intelligent highways had the lowest disengagement frequency (0.008), a 75% reduction compared to normal highways (0.032), and a 52.9% reduction compared to separate lanes (0.017). These findings demonstrate that intelligent highways significantly enhance AV safety. Separate lanes also improved safety but were less effective than intelligent highways. This research supports the development of intelligent infrastructure and designated AV lanes to reduce traffic risks and improve public safety. Limitations include the scope of disengagement frequency as a safety metric. Future studies should incorporate additional accident indicators to further validate these findings.’
